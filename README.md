Implementation of the paper [Bubble Cursor](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi//papers/chi2005bubblecursor.pdf) for the 6.831 UI Implementation and Design class.

Note: This implementation uses SVG and D3.js. In order to control the amplitude, I present a start button on every page, effective width is controlled via a padding property and every circle on the page has a different radius which is randomly generated (other than a fixed set of distractors).
